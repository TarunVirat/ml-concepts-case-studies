# 📂 Unsupervised ML – Anomaly Detection

This project demonstrates **anomaly detection** techniques using unsupervised machine learning algorithms. It identifies outliers in a retail dataset (`Superstore.xls`) that may indicate unusual behavior or potential data issues.

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `Anomaly_Detection.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook implementing and comparing unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms.
- `Superstore.xls` – Dataset containing retail sales data for analysis.

---

## 🔍 Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Unsupervised anomaly detection
- Outlier detection using:
  - Isolation Forest
  - One-Class SVM
  - Elliptic Envelope
- Data visualization of anomalies
- Comparing model predictions for anomaly labeling

## 📊 Dataset

The `Superstore.xls` file includes historical sales and order information from a retail business, used to identify potentially anomalous transactions.

---

## 📌 Goal

To help detect and visualize unusual patterns in retail data that could signal fraud, data entry issues, or rare operational events.
